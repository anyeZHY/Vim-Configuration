### Vim

#### Install and Plugin Via Vundle

```shell
vim ~/.vimrc
```

```shell
:PluginInstall
```

#### My Snippets

You could skim `CheatSheet of my Snippets.md` to get a glimpse of the shortcuts for LaTeX.

```shell
vim ~/.vim/UltiSnips/tex.snippets
```

### LaTeX

In path `LaTeX Templates/`, you could find my templates in which I define many mappings and splendid **Theorem environments**.
